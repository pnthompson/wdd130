        <p>Hi everyone!, I currently live in Lewiston UT. I have been working as a pharmacy technician for the last 16 years, but I really love computers and technology. I'm married and have 2 girls, ages 10 and 6. We like to go for little weekend adventures to different state and national sites of interest. I enjoy movies, in fact I met my wife working at the movie theaters. This was in the time they actually used film reels instead of all digital, thats how old I am. I am pursueing a degree in applied technology. I have dabbled in programming and websites but really want to buckle down and learn it for real. I look forward to learning from all of you!</p>
